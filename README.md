# BUMA-Revamped

This mod is inspired by [BUMA (Bosses Use Meta Ammo](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/mod/980/buma-bosses-use-meta-ammo). Shredder didn’t really see a point in adding config so I did. And also added things to make it mod-compatible. And better.

What the mod does: makes bosses and their followers use one of the best ammo that’s available for the caliber. What bosses and followers? By default, all bosses/followers/raiders/cultist/rogues.
